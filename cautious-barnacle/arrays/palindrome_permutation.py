# Cracking the coding interview 
# Question 1.4
# Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome. 
# A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 
# A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
# EXAMPLE
# Input: Tact Coa
# Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)


# Solution 1
# Description: Check the occurences of letters in the string. 
# If the word is a palindrome or permutation of a palindrome and the length of the letter map is even then ever letter should have an even count.
# If the word is a palindrome or permutation of a palindrome and the length of the letter map is odd then ever letter should have an even count except one.
# Complexity: O(n)
